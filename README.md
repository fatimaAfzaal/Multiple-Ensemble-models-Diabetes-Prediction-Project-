# Diabetes Prediction Project Using Ensemble Models
This project is aimed at building a diabetes prediction model using ensemble machine learning techniques. It involves the following steps:

## Problem Definition

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various health-related features. Early detection of diabetes can significantly improve the chances of effective management and treatment.

## Data Collection and Exploration

In this step, we collected our dataset from Kaggle, which contains various health-related parameters of individuals. We explored the dataset to gain insights into the data and used visualizations to better understand the data distribution.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step to handle missing values and encode categorical data. We also performed correlation analysis to identify important features for our prediction model.

## Model Selection and Training

We experimented with several ensemble machine learning algorithms to build our prediction model. These algorithms include:
- Random Forest Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Bagging Classifier
- Extra Trees Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- Voting Classifier
- Stacking Classifier
- CatBoost Classifier
- Passive Aggressive Classifier

We trained each of these models and evaluated their performance using accuracy metrics.

## Model Evaluation

We assessed the accuracy of each model using the testing dataset and selected the best-performing model for our diabetes prediction task.

## User Input and Prediction

In the final section of the code, users can input health-related parameters, and the trained model will predict whether the individual is likely to have diabetes or not.
